In my Fluid Dynamics class, we were assigned an extra credit project to determine the amount of time it would take for three 3-D printed parts to reach the bottom of a tube filled with water. I opted to use COMSOL Multiphysics to design a simulation that could accurately model these oddly-shaped devices. Using the simulations I determined the terminal velocity of the objects in a water-filled tube, which I used to determine how long the objects would fall for.
