title: Hot Butter Slicer
year: 2019

In my Product Design class, our team was tasked with developing a user-operated device that incorporated NiChrome wire. For this project, our team designed and built a tool that could allow the user to easily slice through cold butter and soften it so it could be spread on toast.

## The Big Picture

In consumer products, one of the most significant design concerns is ergonomics. Is the product comfortable to hold, especially for long periods of time? User-centric products like computer mice, screwdrivers, and potato peelers are designed with user comfort in mind. But how do companies determine what hand they should model their products around, when their product will be used by a huge number of people, all with different hand sizes? Ergonomics diagrams, like the one picture below, can help out. 

The diagram below shows the typical hand measurements for men and women, as well as a range of hand measurements over which 95% of men, women, and children fall under. It also shows the maximum force an average hand can exert in a variety of grips. Using these data, designers are able to make informed choices as to how they should dimension and shape their product so that the greatest number of people can use it comfortably.
