Welcome to my portfolio.

### To do:
1. Make a new "about" page, preferrably in .md format
2. Add a "resume" page
    1. Link the resume page next to the about page at the top of the screen
3. Add thumbnails to each portfolio entry (not 100% sure the best way to do this)
    1. Create a "works" page that contains a gallery of the portfolio entries
    2. ~~Get rid of the index.html page and make the works page the default front page~~
4. Replace the .md image links with embedded .html code (this will allow me to resize the images)
    1. add the images in for all of the portfolio pages
    2. Resize the images so they look nice
5. Add new portfolio entry for EK327 project
6. Add new portfolio entry for ME461 project
7. Edit footer so it isn't shit
8. Once project is over, delete all of the theme files that weren't modified
